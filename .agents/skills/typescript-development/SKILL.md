# TypeScript

The `typescript/` section is a data management framework built on the Fairspec standard and
Polars DataFrames: metadata models, a table engine with per-format plugins, dataset source
plugins, a CLI and an MCP server.

## Commands

Run from the repo root; `pnpm -C typescript <script>` runs a script of this section.

- `pnpm -C typescript test` — build + unit
- `pnpm -C typescript build` — `tsgo` per package, emitting to `<pkg>/build`
- `pnpm -C typescript check:types` — `tsgo --noEmit` per package; build first, packages type-check against each other's `build/`
- `pnpm -C typescript test:unit` — `vp test` across every package
- Single test — `pnpm -C typescript test:unit table/plugins/csv/actions/table/-test/load.unit.ts` (path relative to `typescript/`; bare `vitest` won't load the vite-plus test runtime and fails to collect `vite-plus/test` suites)
- `pnpm -C typescript release` — publish every package (CI only)
- Lint and format are repo-wide: `pnpm check:lint`, `pnpm format`

## Modules

Packages form a strict DAG — `metadata` depends on nothing and everything layers up from it.
Never introduce an edge that reverses this.

```
metadata ─┬─► dataset ───┐
          ├─► extension ─┼─► library ─► mcp-server ─► terminal ─► fairspec
          └─► table ─────┘
```

- `metadata` — zod models (`Resource`, `Dataset`, `TableSchema`, `Column`, `FileDialect`), descriptor load/save, path normalization, JSON Schema profiles. No `@fairspec/*` dependencies; the base of the graph and the only browser-safe core.
- `dataset` — file, folder and stream I/O (`loadFile`, `saveFile`, `prefetchFiles`, temp files) plus dataset-source plugins: ckan, descriptor, folder, github, zenodo, zip.
- `table` — the Polars-backed table engine (normalize/denormalize, column checks and types, schema inference, the dialect sniffer) plus file-format plugins: arrow, csv, inline, json, parquet, sqlite, xlxs.
- `extension` — renderers turning a `TableSchema` into markdown or HTML.
- `library` — the plugin registry (`system.ts`) and the facade actions every consumer calls: `loadTable`, `saveTable`, `loadDataset`, `saveDataset`, `validate*`, `infer*`.
- `mcp-server` — MCP tools over the library actions, served over stdio as `fairspec mcp`.
- `terminal` — the `fairspec` CLI (commander), one command group per entity.
- `fairspec` — umbrella package re-exporting `@fairspec/library` and shipping the CLI binary.
- `project` — the documentation site in `typescript/project/docs/`. Private and outside the DAG: nothing depends on it.

## Code structure

Organise by **concern folder, then entity**: group a file by what it _is_ (an action, a
model, a command), then subgroup by the entity it acts on.

- `actions/<entity>/<verb>.ts` — the operations everything else wraps (`actions/table/save.ts`, `actions/column/create.ts`).
- `models/<entity>.ts` — zod schemas and their derived types.
- `plugins/<name>/` — a self-contained plugin: `plugin.ts` (the class), `settings.ts`, `index.ts`, and its own `actions/` tree.
- `commands/<entity>/<verb>.ts` (terminal) — CLI commands. `tools/<entity>/<verb>.ts` (mcp-server) — MCP tools.
- `helpers/<name>.ts` — small supporting functions. `utils/<name>.ts` — heavier self-contained modules (e.g. `typescript/table/utils/sniffer/`).
- `services/`, `profiles/`, `schemas/`, `params/`, `entrypoints/` — external clients, JSON Schema profiles, bundled schemas, CLI option definitions, executable entry points.
- `typescript/metadata/profiles/` is a copy of `standard/profiles/` written by `pnpm sync:profiles`; never edit it by hand, edit the standard and sync (the root guard fails while they differ)
- Root files, one concern each: `index.ts` (the public API surface), `plugin.ts`, `settings.ts`, `system.ts`, `main.ts`.

### `-test` and `-shared`

A leading `-` marks a directory that is **not a member of the structure around it**.

- **`-test/`** — unit tests and everything that exists only to serve them. `<module>.ts` is tested by `-test/<module>.unit.ts`, fixtures live in `-test/fixtures/`, and generated artifacts (snapshots, vitest-polly HAR recordings) in `-test/fixtures/generated/`. A shared test double goes in the same folder, named after its export.
- **`-shared/`** — _production_ code shared by the siblings around it that must not itself be one of them: a helper among one-action-per-file modules (`actions/column/-shared/helpers.ts`). Not fixtures, not mocks. A `-shared/` folder can hold its own `-test/`.

Test discovery is by the `*.unit.ts` **filename suffix**, not the folder name — the folder is
a structural convention. Move a test and its `fixtures/` together: `resolveSnapshotPath` and
vitest-polly both derive their paths from the test file's own directory.

## Conventions

- Package manager pnpm `^11`, Node `^24`, ES Modules throughout
- Formatting is configured in the root `vite.config.ts`: no semicolons, 90-column print width, arrow parens avoided
- Function names are **verbNoun** — a verb plus the noun it acts on (`saveArrowTable`, `inferTableSchemaFromTable`, `createColumnFromProperty`), never a bare verb or bare noun
- Files are camelCase, named after the verb **without repeating the folder** — `actions/column/create.ts` exports `createColumnFromProperty`, not `createColumn.ts`
- One export per file is the default, not an absolute: a file may export a closely related pair (`typescript/dataset/actions/file/temp.ts` exports `getTempFilePath` and `writeTempFile`)
- Use relative imports with the full `.ts`/`.tsx` file extension
- **`index.ts` barrels are deliberate and required.** Every package publishes `"exports": "./build/index.js"`, and its `index.ts` is a curated list of explicit named re-exports — never `export *`. Adding a public API means adding its line there.
- Add brief docstrings for exported functions and models (explain what it does)

## Specs

- Unit tests are Vitest via vite-plus, named `*.unit.ts`, in collocated `-test` folders
- Import test symbols from `vite-plus/test`, not `vitest`
- Don't add useless comments like "Arrange", "Act", "Assert"
- **The suite must pass on Windows — CI runs `pnpm -C typescript test:unit` there.** Never assert on a raw path string: `readlink`, `join` and `import.meta.dirname` all speak the platform separator, so `expect(target).toBe("../AGENTS.md")` passes locally and fails on Windows with a backslashed target. Compare paths only after `resolve()`-ing both sides, and match file content against `\r?\n`, never a bare newline literal.
- `library/-test/conformance.unit.ts` runs the shared `conformance/` suite; a behaviour both
  libraries share gets a conformance test there, not only a unit test here (**`conformance-development`**)
- Network tests use `useRecording()` from `vitest-polly`; the HAR lands in `-test/fixtures/generated/<test-name>_<hash>/`. Renaming a `describe`/`it` renames that directory, so the old recording is orphaned and the next run silently re-records from the live network — check `git status` after renaming a recorded test.

## Releases

This section is the `typescript` release-please component: tags `typescript-vX.Y.Z`, its own
Release PR, published to npm by `release.yaml`. All packages are lock-stepped to one version
via `extra-files`. Only changes to the published packages use `feat` or `fix`; tests, the docs
in `typescript/project/`, READMEs and tooling are `chore` or `docs`. When in doubt, ask whether
the change alters what someone installing a package gets.
