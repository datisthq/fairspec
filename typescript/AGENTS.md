# fairspec-typescript

TypeScript pnpm monorepo — a data management framework built on the Fairspec standard and
Polars DataFrames: metadata models, a table engine with per-format plugins, dataset source
plugins, a CLI and an MCP server.

## Rules

- **Never commit unless asked to**
- **Never add co-authored by Claude Code to commits!**
- **Never push main or pull requests to origin unless asked to**
- **Never amend or rewrite existing commits unless asked** (`git commit --amend`, `git reset` of already-made commits, `git rebase`, force-squash) — other worktrees or sessions may be based on those commits. Fold in changes with a follow-up commit instead.
- Prioritize using LSP capabilities if possible
- When resolving a TODO, follow its instructions literally
- Run type checking, specs and linting as part of your tasks
- Start a plan from a new/updated API summary (models/signatures) and the most challenging points, then continue with your default settings
- Update docs when a change requires it
- **After every task, check whether a skill in `.agents/skills/` needs updating, and update it in the same commit.** Read the task description for what it taught: a new convention, a correction to how the work was done, or a decision about how an area should look or behave. Write that into the skill for that area, so the next session follows it without being told again. When no skill covers the area and the lesson will recur, add one.

## Skills

Depth lives in `.agents/skills/` (reached by Claude Code through the `.claude/skills` symlink `pnpm install` creates), so
this file carries invariants and the skills carry procedure. Reach for one before working in
its area. Each is named `<subject>-<facet>`, subject first (`change-review`):

| skill           | when                                                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `change-review` | reviewing a pull request — also what the review workflow runs |

## Commands

- `pnpm install` — install all dependencies
- `pnpm test` — full gate: lint + build + unit
- `pnpm lint` — `vp fmt --check && vp lint` (vite-plus)
- `pnpm format` — `vp fmt`, auto-fix formatting
- `pnpm type` — `tsgo --noEmit`, recursive across packages
- `pnpm unit` — `vp test` — run from the repo root
- Single test — `pnpm unit path/to/file.unit.ts` (bare `vitest` won't load the vite-plus test runtime and fails to collect `vite-plus/test` suites)
- `pnpm build` — `tsgo` per package, emitting to `<pkg>/build`
- `pnpm leaks` / `pnpm vulns` / `pnpm scan` — gitleaks / semgrep / both
- `pnpm deps` — update all dependencies to their latest versions
- `pnpm docs:start` / `pnpm docs:build` — the livemark documentation site

## Modules

Packages form a strict DAG — `metadata` depends on nothing and everything layers up from it.
Never introduce an edge that reverses this.

```
metadata ─┬─► dataset ───┐
          ├─► extension ─┼─► library ─► mcp-server ─► terminal ─► fairspec
          └─► table ─────┘
```

- `metadata` — zod models (`Resource`, `Dataset`, `TableSchema`, `Column`, `FileDialect`), descriptor load/save, path normalization, JSON Schema profiles. No `@fairspec/*` dependencies; the base of the graph and the only browser-safe core.
- `dataset` — file, folder and stream I/O (`loadFile`, `saveFile`, `prefetchFiles`, temp files) plus dataset-source plugins: ckan, descriptor, folder, github, zenodo, zip.
- `table` — the Polars-backed table engine (normalize/denormalize, column checks and types, schema inference, the dialect sniffer) plus file-format plugins: arrow, csv, inline, json, parquet, sqlite, xlxs.
- `extension` — renderers turning a `TableSchema` into markdown or HTML.
- `library` — the plugin registry (`system.ts`) and the facade actions every consumer calls: `loadTable`, `saveTable`, `loadDataset`, `saveDataset`, `validate*`, `infer*`.
- `mcp-server` — MCP tools over the library actions, served over stdio as `fairspec mcp`.
- `terminal` — the `fairspec` CLI (commander), one command group per entity.
- `fairspec` — umbrella package re-exporting `@fairspec/library` and shipping the CLI binary.
- `project` — the documentation site in `docs/` and the docs guard in `-test/`. Private and outside the DAG: nothing depends on it.

## Code structure

Organise by **concern folder, then entity**: group a file by what it _is_ (an action, a
model, a command), then subgroup by the entity it acts on.

- `actions/<entity>/<verb>.ts` — the operations everything else wraps (`actions/table/save.ts`, `actions/column/create.ts`).
- `models/<entity>.ts` — zod schemas and their derived types.
- `plugins/<name>/` — a self-contained plugin: `plugin.ts` (the class), `settings.ts`, `index.ts`, and its own `actions/` tree.
- `commands/<entity>/<verb>.ts` (terminal) — CLI commands. `tools/<entity>/<verb>.ts` (mcp-server) — MCP tools.
- `helpers/<name>.ts` — small supporting functions. `utils/<name>.ts` — heavier self-contained modules (e.g. `table/utils/sniffer/`).
- `services/`, `profiles/`, `schemas/`, `params/`, `entrypoints/` — external clients, JSON Schema profiles, bundled schemas, CLI option definitions, executable entry points.
- Root files, one concern each: `index.ts` (the public API surface), `plugin.ts`, `settings.ts`, `system.ts`, `main.ts`.

### `-test` and `-shared`

A leading `-` marks a directory that is **not a member of the structure around it**.

- **`-test/`** — unit tests and everything that exists only to serve them. `<module>.ts` is tested by `-test/<module>.unit.ts`, fixtures live in `-test/fixtures/`, and generated artifacts (snapshots, vitest-polly HAR recordings) in `-test/fixtures/generated/`. A shared test double goes in the same folder, named after its export.
- **`-shared/`** — _production_ code shared by the siblings around it that must not itself be one of them: a helper among one-action-per-file modules (`actions/column/-shared/helpers.ts`). Not fixtures, not mocks. A `-shared/` folder can hold its own `-test/`.

Test discovery is by the `*.unit.ts` **filename suffix**, not the folder name — the folder is
a structural convention. Move a test and its `fixtures/` together: `resolveSnapshotPath` and
vitest-polly both derive their paths from the test file's own directory.

## Formats

- Use 2-space indentation, UTF-8 encoding, and LF line endings
- Formatting is configured in `vite.config.ts`: no semicolons, 90-column print width, arrow parens avoided
- Use PascalCase for classes, interfaces and types; camelCase for methods and variables
- Place high-level public items first in a file and low-level private items last

## Conventions

- Package manager pnpm `^11`, Node `^24`, ES Modules throughout
- Function names are **verbNoun** — a verb plus the noun it acts on (`saveArrowTable`, `inferTableSchemaFromTable`, `createColumnFromProperty`), never a bare verb or bare noun
- Files are camelCase, named after the verb **without repeating the folder** — `actions/column/create.ts` exports `createColumnFromProperty`, not `createColumn.ts`
- One export per file is the default, not an absolute: a file may export a closely related pair (`dataset/actions/file/temp.ts` exports `getTempFilePath` and `writeTempFile`)
- Use relative imports with the full `.ts`/`.tsx` file extension
- **`index.ts` barrels are deliberate and required.** Every package publishes `"exports": "./build/index.js"`, and its `index.ts` is a curated list of explicit named re-exports — never `export *`. Adding a public API means adding its line there.
- Commit style: Conventional Commits (`feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`); release-please derives the version and changelog from them — see **Releases**

## Types

- Use strict TypeScript with null checks, but don't add explicit return types to functions
- Never use TypeScript `any`, type casting `as`, or `!` without permission

## Specs

- Unit tests are Vitest via vite-plus, named `*.unit.ts`, in collocated `-test` folders
- Import test symbols from `vite-plus/test`, not `vitest`
- Don't add useless comments like "Arrange", "Act", "Assert"
- **The suite must pass on Windows — CI runs it there via `pnpm test:win`.** Never assert on a raw path string: `readlink`, `join` and `import.meta.dirname` all speak the platform separator, so `expect(target).toBe("../AGENTS.md")` passes locally and fails on Windows with a backslashed target. Compare paths only after `resolve()`-ing both sides, and match file content against `\r?\n`, never a bare newline literal.
- Network tests use `useRecording()` from `vitest-polly`; the HAR lands in `-test/fixtures/generated/<test-name>_<hash>/`. Renaming a `describe`/`it` renames that directory, so the old recording is orphaned and the next run silently re-records from the live network — check `git status` after renaming a recorded test.

## Releases

Conventional Commits drive [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please): a
`feat` or `fix` landing on `main` opens a Release PR, and merging that PR cuts the version,
tags it and publishes. Merging is the gate — nothing ships without it.

- **IMPORTANT: only changes to the published packages use `feat` or `fix`.** Everything else MUST be
  `chore` or `docs` — CI and workflows, release config, dependencies, tooling, `AGENTS.md`,
  the README, the docs site
- This is not a style preference. release-please reads the commit type: a `fix:` on a workflow
  file cuts a release and burns a version number on a change no consumer can observe. Version
  numbers can never be reused
- When in doubt, ask whether the change alters what someone installing a package gets.
  If it does not, it is `chore`
- Release config lives in `.release/config.json` and `.release/manifest.json`. The manifest
  holds the current version and release-please maintains it — never hand-edit it

## Docs

- Add Typedoc comments only for public APIs; don't add them for files or use `@params` directives
- Add brief docstrings for exported functions and models (explain what it does)
- **Comments must not outnumber code.** If a file has more comment lines than code lines, the comments get cut, not the code. A single comment is at most ~3 lines. The bar is not "true" or "useful context" — it is: **name the specific mistake this comment prevents**. If you cannot name one in a sentence, delete it. Most code needs no comment at all: a file with zero is the normal case, not a gap to fill.
- **Design rationale is git history, not file content.** `git log`/`git blame` already hold why a thing was chosen and what it replaced. A file carries only what someone editing THAT line needs in order not to break something — a non-obvious invariant, a failure that presents as success, a deliberate deviation from a rule in this file.
- Never worth a line: restating what the next statement plainly does · explaining what a well-named function already names · narrating rejected alternatives · defending a choice nobody would question · a preamble on every entry in a config object
